# Medical_Insurance_Prediction
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict medical insurance costs based on various demographic and health related factors
## The project will involve the following steps:

### - Data collection: 
Gather and clean data from the databases and external sources, such as public health data and census data.

### - Exploratory data analysis: 
Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data, and to gain insights into the relationships between different variables.

### - Feature engineering: 
Select and transform the relevant features that are most predictive of medical insurance claims.

### - Model selection and training: 
Compare and evaluate different models, such as regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, to identify the best performing model.

### - Model evaluation and optimization: 
Validate the model's performance using statistical metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and fine-tune the model using hyperparameter optimization techniques.

### - Flask And Postman: 
Using flask we write a feamework in python and using postmen we predict the insurance charges using independent features
